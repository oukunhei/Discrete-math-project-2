# Discrete-math-project-2

## Task Description
- Implement the RSA algorithm with the key generation, encryption, and decryption functions.
- Implement the ElGamal algorithm with the key generation, encryption, and decryption functions.
- Test the implementation with the encryption/decryption of short and long “textual” messages.
- Analyze the performance and security level of RSA and ElGamal.
