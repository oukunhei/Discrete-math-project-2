# Discrete-math-project-2

## Task Description
- Implement the RSA algorithm with the key generation, encryption, and decryption functions.
- Implement the ElGamal algorithm with the key generation, encryption, and decryption functions.
- Test the implementation with the encryption/decryption of short and long “textual” messages.
- Analyze the performance and security level of RSA and ElGamal.


## Getting Started

### Verifying Installation
Run the following command to check if dependencies are installed successfully:
```bash
python -c "import hashlib; print('hashlib loaded successfully!')"
```
If no errors occur, the environment setup is complete.

## Run Demo

```python
python test.py
```
