# RSA Algorithm

This RSA algorithm includes utilities for generating prime numbers, RSA key pairs, and performing cryptographic operations.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required (install via `pip`):

```bash
pip install cryptography
```

## Core files
- `RSA_1.py`: Contains the main RSA class with basic methods for generating keys, encrypting, and decrypting messages.
- `RSA_2.py`: Implement PKCS#1 v1.5to prevent padding oracle attack
- `RSA_3.py`: The hybrid encryption implementation of RSA encryption algorithm and AES symmetric encryption algorithm
- `RSA_4.py`: Adopt cryptography package to add OAEP padding and PKCS#1 v1.5 padding
- `RSA_eval.py`: Test example - to be modified
- `RSA_eval1.py`: Test example - to be modified
- `RSA_textual.py`: Test example - to be modified


## Usage
```bash
python RSA_1.py
```
all can directly run, but evaluation need to be improved
